# EmbeddedSystemSoftware_C_and_ASM_
Projects from Embedded Systems(EEL 4742) & their details

Project Details:

- Both the C code and ASM has the same behavior amonsgt their respective project

Project 2:

- create a program that allowed us to type an uppercase “G” or “Y” and the green and yellow LEDs on the
MSP430 should change state accordingly(LEDs were located at P2 on the MSP430 microcontroller).

Project 3: 

-  C language and assembly language programs that converts ASCII characters to binary and hexadecimal numbers.
The UART on the MSP430FG4618 is used via hyperterminal to enter in ASCII data and to display ASCII data. 

Project 4:

- develop C language and assembly language programs that provide an interface and interact
with a matrix LCD module.

Project 5(part1):
  
-  a program that inputs from the keyboard two hexadecimal numbers via HyperTerminal. These two numbers should
then be displayed in the HyperTerminal window and on the right most two digits of the LCD Display on 
the experimenter board.

Project 5(part2):

- a program that inputs two hexadecimal digits followed by the “+” symbol to indicate addition. Next, 
the user enters a second set of two hexadecimal digits that are to be added to the first two hexadecimal digits. 
The result of this addition is then shown on both the HyperTerminal window and the LCD Display.

Project 5(part3):

- a program that inputs two ASCII hexadecimal digits, followed by the “-“ symbol to indicate subtraction. 
Next, the user enters a second set of two hexadecimal digits that are to be subtracted from the first two hexadecimal 
digits. The result of this subtraction operation is to be displayed on both the HyperTerminal window and on the LCD Display.

Project 5(part4): 

- a program that inputs two ASCII hexadecimal digits followed by the “*” symbol to indicate multiplication. The user
should then enter a second set of two hexadecimal digits that are to be multiplied with the first set of hexadecimal digits. 
The multiplication result is shown on both the HyperTerminal window as well as the LCD Display.

Project 6:

- program that uses the timer and interrupts to control the timed execution of an event. An interrupt 
service routine will be written to flash the LED’s on the experimenter board at a given rate. 
Also a real time clock and a stop watch will be implemented.
